    <li>Scroll down the instructions to play the Game</li>
    <li>Instructions --- ></li>
    <ol type="1"><li>Starting the Game: Click any key to initiate the game.</li>

    <li>Gameplay:
        The game begins by illuminating one of the four colored buttons (green, red, yellow, blue) in a specific sequence.
        Pay attention to the sequence as the game progresses, as it will increase in complexity by adding one more color/tone at a time.
        Your task is to repeat the sequence by clicking on the buttons in the same order they were displayed by the game.
    </li>
    
    <li>Player's Turn:
      After the game shows the sequence, it's your turn to replicate that sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.
      Each correct sequence inputted by the player progresses the game to the next level with an extended sequence.
      </li>
    
    <li>Game Continuation:The game continues with the pattern becoming progressively longer and more challenging as the levels increase.
        Even if you make a mistake in repeating the sequence, the game will allow you to start again from the beginning.
    </li></ol>
